        <p>
          This place, however you found it, is my small digital space in this vast world.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Maciej and I am the creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, this might not be too specific description, as I enjoy many little bits from wide range of arts. There is beauty in mechanical engineering, and there's mathematical miracle hidden in good design of something as simple as smartphone dock or a chair.
        </p>
        <p>
          We live in digital world full of beauty. Creation process of digital tools is one of the things that give me pleasure. It can be very calming, like brewing tea in perfect silence disturbed only by the song of nightingale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, no tool, no painting, no design, and no song is made perfect offhand. Iteration by iteration I try to be better human being and create better world around myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, here we are. It is not my plan "A", nor "B". This is "plan: h" - the branding I'll use to remember all the way that took me here.
