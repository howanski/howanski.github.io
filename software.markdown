          Well, that's a toolbox, actually, but <b><i>who</i></b> never daydreamed to be the <b><i>madman with the box</i></b>?

          OK, this is not the bust pun in the world, this is just a tribute...
          <br>However, I'd like to create here on <a href="https://github.com/howanski" target="_blank">Github</a> some space for code I've written and haven't sold copyrights to, might that be production-ready, standalone applications or life saving oneliners written in shell in the middle of the caffeinated night.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br>If there's a source code and you want it - just get it. It's yours, for free, I haven't lost a cent - I just had fun, just like playing with LEGOs and turning dumptruck in a spaceship. (Been there, done that way before I had my first PC - Atari 130 XE.)
