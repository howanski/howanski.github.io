        <p>
          Well, that's a toolbox, actually, but <b><i>who</i></b> never daydreamed to be the <b><i>madman with the box</i></b>?

          OK, this is not the bust pun in the world, this is just a tribute...
          <br>However, I'd like to create here some space for code I've written and haven't sold copyrights to, might that be production-ready, standalone applications or life saving oneliners written in shell in the middle of the caffeinated night.
          <br>If there's a source code and you want it - just get it. It's yours, for free, I haven't lost a cent. What's better than playing with LEGOs and turning dumptruck in a spaceship? (And yes, I did it literally, long time ago. Before I had my first PC - Atari 130 XE.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm gonna be totally honest with you - I'm doing it also for myself. My hard drive is full of programs which even I don't know what they're for. From time to time I stumble upon folder from 2005 with pile of python or ruby code and some severed limb made of C that makes me wonder why did I do that and can it help someone after stitching.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I'm turning to using GitHub for my code like an <i>adult</i>, I'll put READMEs in here, so they won't be so unpleasant for the eye.
